                                <p class="raleway pAbout">Established in 1953, the Pasadena Community Foundation is a tax-exempt public charity created by and for the people of Pasadena. We work with individuals, families, and organizations to establish philanthropic funds, create and build endowment funds, and distribute charitable gifts to nonprofit organizations in Pasadena and across the country.
                                    In addition to donor-directed grants and scholarships, PCF makes annual grants in six areas: arts and culture, education, environment, health, human services, and youth. These grants are restricted to Pasadena-area nonprofits to enrich the community and provide vital services to vulnerable residents. PCF is Pasadena’s permanent endowment for public good, building hometown legacies that benefit our community now and for decades to come.
