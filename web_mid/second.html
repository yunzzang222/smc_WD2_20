Although the focus of the store has changed to soda pop and beer from around the world, Galco’s still maintain Italian deli in the back of their retail store. 

                In addition to soda shelves, people are amazed to find a wide selection of craft beers (local, national and international) along with such alcoholic spirits as hard ciders, hard-to-find sakes, exotic wines, French champagnes, honey meads and more. Galco’s also stocks a variety of artisanal waters for everyone’s drinking pleasure. Kids of all ages enjoy checking out our vintage candies and sweets next to a retro toy corner where you can pick up a memory or two.</b></p></div>

                Galco’s moved to Highland Park in 1955. Today, in keeping with Galco’s motto of Freedom of Choice, the Galco’s deli offers a variety of sandwiches alongside the original Blockbuster. Also, in keeping with Galco’s commitment to support small, local businesses, deli ingredients come from family-owned stores in the area</p></div>
